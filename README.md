# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is a uncleaned dataset in which the data contains the details of Orders placed having Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Unit Price, Order Date, and purchase address of a Retail store.

Also, we will be answering a few important business Questions to get on to some reliable decisions that can be taken.
